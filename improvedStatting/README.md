This is an improved statting script, that automatically helps you mend your weapon, manages the lanterns, and stores all your stats to a text file in a location you specificy.

Before you use it, make certain you adjust the location in the trigger "Restat (Hunter stats use w CAUTION!)" and "Restat (channeler stats use w CAUTION!)" where you want to store your stats. Otherwise it will save it to C:/users/Joost/, while you want tsomething like your username.

2 aliases:

enable_stat and disable_stat to quickly enable and disable this script.

One additional alias to set your statweapon --> statweapon xxx. This will help remove / wield your weapon.

Make certain you hold an oilstone/sandstone. In that case the script will try to mend scratched weapons automatically (mattock, claymore, staff). you can of course add your own weapon of choice there.
